						<p class="fsw-12">*American Express relies on accurate airline transaction data to identify incidental fee purchases. If you do not see a credit for a qualifying incidental purchase on your eligible Card after 4 weeks, simply call the number on the back of your Card.

						<p>You will get one point for each dollar charged for an eligible purchase on your  Platinum Card from American Express. You will get 4 additional points (for a total of 5 points) for each dollar spent on eligible air and hotel purchases. Eligible air purchases are purchases of scheduled flights made directly with a passenger airline or through American Express Travel (via the phone by calling 1-800-525-3355 or online via <a href="https://www.amextravel.com" target="_blank">amextravel.com</a>), minus returns and credits. Charter flights, private jet flights, flights that are part of travel packages, tours, or cruises, and flights booked via the phone through American Express Travel on airlines that do not accept American Express are excluded. Eligible hotel purchases are prepaid hotel purchases or prepaid travel packages booked on <a href="https://www.amextravel.com" target="_blank">amextravel.com</a> with your eligible Platinum Card (including hotels and flight+hotel packages) and charged to the same eligible Platinum Card, minus returns and credits. To modify a reservation, you must cancel and rebook your reservation.  You can cancel and rebook your reservation on <a href="https://www.amextravel.com" target="_blank">amextravel.com</a> or by calling a representative of <a href="https://www.amextravel.com" target="_blank">amextravel.com</a> at 1-800-297-2977.  Cancellations are subject to hotel cancellation policies.  If hotel reservations are made or modified directly with the hotel provider, the reservation will NOT be eligible for 5X points. Eligible air and hotel purchases do NOT include non-prepaid hotels, hotel group reservations or events, car rental or cruise purchases, ticketing service or other fees, interest charges, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents.</p>

						<p>Bonuses you may receive with your Card on other purchase categories or in connection with promotions or offers from American Express may not be combined with this offer. Any portion of a charge that you elect to cover through redemption of Membership Rewards points is not eligible to receive points. The benefits associated with the Additional Card(s) you choose may be different than the benefits associated with your basic Card. Additional terms and restrictions apply. Merchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. A purchase will not qualify for additional points if the merchant’s code is not eligible. Air or hotel purchases made through a third-party payment account or on an online travel agency will not qualify for additional points. A purchase may not qualify for additional points if the merchant submits the purchase using a mobile or wireless card reader or if you use a mobile or digital wallet. See <a href="http://membershiprewards.com/terms" target="_blank">membershiprewards.com/terms</a> for the Membership Rewards program terms and conditions or to learn the benefits associated with the Additional Card(s) you choose, please call the number on the back of your Card.</p>

You agree to pay all Charges without regard to whether any Charges exceed a limit, and you agree that we are not liable to you or any other person when a limit is not applied to any Charges and/or when Charges are incurred and billed that exceed a limit. While we typically require merchants to obtain an authorization for purchases and submit final transaction documentation for payment in a timely manner, a limit may not apply or may be exceeded when a merchant does not obtain an authorization for any reason; when a merchant obtains an authorization for a partial amount of the final charge submitted to us for payment; or when such submissions are not submitted or processed at the same time that the authorization is obtained. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Charges made outside of the U.S., in duty-free stores, or on board airplanes or cruise vessels; international airline ticket Purchases; vehicle rentals; lodging stays extended beyond original reservation period; certain mail order Purchases; Purchases billed on a recurring basis; Purchases at gas stations; telecommunications charges, including charges incurred with calling cards; taxicab charges; security deposits; late, damage or other fees in connection with rentals; Purchases billed in installments; restaurant tips and other gratuities; and Charges that occur before the end of billing period, if the Charge is posted to your Account after the Closing Date of that billing period. Any limit will not be applied to Charges for foreign currency or for travelers cheques or gift cheques obtained other than by telephone from us. The Spending Limit for the Additional Card Member(s) is optional. If no Spending Limit is set on the Additional Card, spending capacity on this Card will be subject to the Basic Card Member's account terms and conditions. </p>

						<p><strong>This offer is available online only to Basic Card Members</strong>. Please allow 8–12 weeks for the Referral Bonus to post to your account after each referred individual is approved for the Card. You cannot earn a Referral Bonus for those who currently have the Card you recommended or for individuals who have been referred by someone else. Due to the confidential nature of the credit approval process, you will not be notified of whether we approve or decline any application(s) from individual(s) you refer. Also, the individuals you refer may not receive the referral email if they have previously “opted out” of receiving email marketing communications from American Express. Any violation or abuse of this program may result in the forfeiture of the Referral Bonus. In order to receive the Referral Bonus, your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment. Terms & restrictions of the rewards program corresponding to your Card account apply. NOTE: The value of the Referral Bonus may be taxable income to you; <strong>you are responsible for any federal or state taxes resulting from the Referral Bonus</strong>. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions about the tax treatment of the Referral Bonus. </p>
